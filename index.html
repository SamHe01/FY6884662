      The 2011 Tohoku tsunami caused unprecedented structural failures in coastal areas, offering critical insights into tsunami loading mechanisms and the resilience of various building designs. 
      This article examines these failures using analyses informed by the newly developed ASCE 7 Tsunami Loads and Effects chapter, 
      focusing on Energy Grade Line (EGL) analysis for flow depth and velocity estimation.
      Two case studies—a reinforced concrete (RC) structure overturned by buoyancy and a steel-frame building subjected to hydrodynamic forces—illustrate the limitations of conventional designs. 
      Findings highlight the importance of tsunami-specific design, especially for critical infrastructure, and the reliability of the ASCE 7 standard for load prediction. 
      By integrating tsunami and seismic considerations, these advancements offer a pathway to improving the resilience of coastal structures against future disasters.

   <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
      The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 represented one of the most devastating natural disasters of the modern era.
      With waves reaching heights of over 40 meters in some areas and penetrating up to 10 kilometres inland, the disaster caused widespread destruction to both life and property. 
      Coastal regions bore the brunt of the tsunami's fury, with more than 120,000 buildings destroyed and many others rendered uninhabitable. 
      The ¥16.9 trillion economic toll included not only direct property damage but also significant disruptions to food supply chains, energy infrastructure 
      and regional economies dependent on tourism and industry.
      The structural failures observed during this disaster highlighted the inadequacy of traditional building designs in the face of tsunami forces. 
      This article aims to explore these failures, focusing on key lessons derived from the event and the role of updated design standards in mitigating future risks.
      By analysing case studies and applying the methodologies outlined in the ASCE 7 Tsunami Loads and Effects chapter, 
      this paper seeks to illustrate how advancements in engineering can enhance the resilience of coastal structures.
      The analysis begins by examining the nature of tsunami-induced forces, followed by detailed case studies that reveal the limitations of conventional designs.
      The conclusion offers a synthesis of the findings and recommendations for future improvements.

      Tsunami Loading Mechanisms
      Tsunamis generate a range of forces that can overwhelm traditional structural designs. These forces include hydrostatic pressure, which applies constant loads to submerged structures, 
      and hydrodynamic drag, which exerts lateral forces as water flows past and through buildings.
      Additionally, debris carried by the tsunami can collide with structures, causing localized impact 
      damage that compromises their integrity. Scouring, or the removal of soil around foundations,
      further exacerbates structural vulnerabilities by undermining the stability of even well-designed buildings.

      To address these challenges, the ASCE 7 standard provides a comprehensive framework for estimating tsunami loads. One of its key methodologies is the Energy Grade Line (EGL) analysis, 
      which predicts flow depth and velocity by accounting for topography and hydraulic friction.
      This approach is particularly valuable for its conservative estimates, ensuring safety even under worst-case scenarios.

      Case Studies of Structural Failure
      The first case study involves a two-story reinforced concrete building in Onagawa, which was overturned by buoyant forces. This structure's failure was primarily due to hydrostatic uplift, 
      where the weight of the building was insufficient to counteract the upward pressure exerted by inundating water. Detailed analysis using ASCE 7 Load Case 1 showed that the hydrostatic uplift 
      force reached 10,620 kN, far exceeding the 9,000 kN provided by the building's deadweight. Such failures underscore the need for stronger anchorage and foundation designs.

      Flow Profiles in Onagawa
      The reliability of EGL analysis is exemplified through its application in Onagawa, where it was used to model flow depths and velocities across several transects. Despite differences in 
      transect lengths and orientations, the analysis revealed minimal variation in predicted flow depth and velocity at the shoreline, demonstrating the robustness of the EGL method.

      Steel Frame Building Under Hydrodynamic Forces
      Another failure involved a three-story steel-frame building subjected to incoming and outgoing hydrodynamic forces in Onagawa. Non-structural walls were destroyed
      and the frame sustained significant lateral deformation.
      ASCE 7 Load Case 2 analysis estimated a lateral force of 20,510 kN, revealing that the building's lateral force-resisting system was inadequately designed to withstand such extreme loads.

   <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
       The 2011 Tohoku tsunami provided a tragic yet invaluable opportunity to study the vulnerabilities of coastal structures under extreme loading conditions. 
       This article analysed two significant failures—a reinforced concrete building overturned by buoyant forces and a steel-frame building deformed by hydrodynamic drag.
       These examples illustrated the limitations of traditional design practices and underscored the importance of adopting tsunami-specific standards like those outlined in ASCE 7.
       Key insights include the reliability of Energy Grade Line analysis for predicting flow characteristics and the critical need for stronger foundations and lateral force-resisting systems. 
       Moreover, the integration of seismic and tsunami considerations into building codes can significantly enhance the resilience of coastal infrastructure.
