      The 2011 Tohoku tsunami caused unprecedented structural failures in coastal areas, offering critical insights into tsunami loading mechanisms and the resilience of various building designs. 
      This article examines these failures using analyses informed by the newly developed ASCE 7 Tsunami Loads and Effects chapter, focusing on Energy Grade Line (EGL) analysis for flow depth and velocity estimation.
      Two case studies—a reinforced concrete (RC) structure overturned by buoyancy and a steel-frame building subjected to hydrodynamic forces—illustrate the limitations of conventional designs. 
      Findings highlight the importance of tsunami-specific design, especially for critical infrastructure, and the reliability of the ASCE 7 standard for load prediction. 
      By integrating tsunami and seismic considerations, these advancements offer a pathway to improving the resilience of coastal structures against future disasters.

   <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
      The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011 represented one of the most devastating natural disasters of the modern era.
      With waves reaching heights of over 40 meters in some areas and penetrating up to 10 kilometres inland, the disaster caused widespread destruction to both life and property. 
      Coastal regions bore the brunt of the tsunami's fury, with more than 120,000 buildings destroyed and many others rendered uninhabitable. 
      The ¥16.9 trillion economic toll included not only direct property damage but also significant disruptions to food supply chains, energy infrastructure, and regional economies dependent on tourism and industry.
      The structural failures observed during this disaster highlighted the inadequacy of traditional building designs in the face of tsunami forces. 
      This article aims to explore these failures, focusing on key lessons derived from the event and the role of updated design standards in mitigating future risks.
      By analysing case studies and applying the methodologies outlined in the ASCE 7 Tsunami Loads and Effects chapter, this paper seeks to illustrate how advancements in engineering can enhance the resilience of coastal structures.
      The analysis begins by examining the nature of tsunami-induced forces, followed by detailed case studies that reveal the limitations of conventional designs.
      The conclusion offers a synthesis of the findings and recommendations for future improvements.

   <h3 id="AnalysisAndDiscussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
      The Tohoku tsunami demonstrated the critical importance of advanced hydrodynamic analysis for structural resilience. Key findings emphasize the need for robust lateral force-resisting systems in steel-frame buildings and anchorage designs that counteract buoyancy in reinforced concrete structures.
      Advanced modeling methods, such as EGL analysis, provided conservative yet accurate predictions of flow characteristics, highlighting their utility in coastal engineering applications.

   <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
   <p class="ex1">
      <pre>
       The 2011 Tohoku tsunami provided a tragic yet invaluable opportunity to study the vulnerabilities of coastal structures under extreme loading conditions. 
       This article analysed two significant failures—a reinforced concrete building overturned by buoyant forces and a steel-frame building deformed by hydrodynamic drag.
       These examples illustrated the limitations of traditional design practices and underscored the importance of adopting tsunami-specific standards like those outlined in ASCE 7.
       Key insights include the reliability of Energy Grade Line analysis for predicting flow characteristics and the critical need for stronger foundations and lateral force-resisting systems. 
      Moreover, the integration of seismic and tsunami considerations into building codes can significantly enhance the resilience of coastal infrastructure. 
      By learning from past failures and applying these lessons to future designs, engineers can ensure that structures in tsunami-prone areas are equipped to withstand even the most severe events.
